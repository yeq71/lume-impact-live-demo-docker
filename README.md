# lume-impact-live-demo-docker

Demonstration of LUME-Impact running a live model fetching data from the LCLS EPICS network using Docker containers.

This repository converts the [lume-impact-live-demo](https://github.com/ChristopherMayes/lume-impact-live-demo) application to a Docker image and shows how to run it.

# Building the image

When a tag is pushed to this GitHub repository, a Docker image is automatically built and pushed to Dockerhub using GitHub Actions. The DockerHub repository is [lume-impact-live-demo](https://hub.docker.com/r/tidair/lume-impact-live-demo).
